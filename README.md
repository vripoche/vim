Vim
===

The Vim configuration (.vimrc) I use.

Setup
-----

This configuration works with NeoBundle, it must be installed before:
[NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

All plugins will be automatically installed on the first Vim opening.

The plugin [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) needs requirements.

For mac users, Vim must be linked to the last version of Macvim.
If it was installed with Homebrew: 
`$brew link macvim`

For Linux users, make sure you have Vim installed with the Python2 support.
