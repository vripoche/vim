# Vim

The Vim configuration (`.vimrc`) I use.

## Setup

This configuration works with Vundle, it must be installed before:
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

All plugins will be automatically installed on the first Vim opening.

The plugin [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) needs requirements.

For mac users, Vim must be linked to the last version of Macvim.
If it was installed with Homebrew:
`$brew link macvim`

For Linux users, make sure you have Vim installed with the Python3 support.

# NeoVim

The NVim configuration (`init.vim` + `coc-settings.json`) I use.

## Setup

Vim Plug should be installed before:
[Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
